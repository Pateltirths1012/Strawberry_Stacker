# Strawberry_Stacker

Theme Description: Reduce physical toil on strawberry farms by making strawberry stacking for transport
an automated process using multicopters. You will learn concepts in control systems, image processing,
mission planners and distributed systems, while using the typical software stacks used to control flying
vehicles and plan missions for them. The final goal is to build an application where we control a team of
multicopters and achieve the task of picking strawberry boxes from a field and stacking them onto a
transport trailer. These tasks take place in a simulated environment that allows us to prototype our
application quickly and smoothly, while ensuring application transferability to real hardware.

Theme Learning: ROS, Gazebo, PX4 Autopilot, Python.

Team Learning: The team has been awarded Level 2 in the e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC).

This level indicates that the team was able to demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem statement
via a full implementation and was in top 10-30 ranked team in the competition
